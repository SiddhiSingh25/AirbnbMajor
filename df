🚀 Presenting My Full->Stack Project: An Airbnb Clone!

After 15 days of dedication, I’m excited to share my Airbnb clone project! This project was a deep dive into full-stack development, involving both front-end and back-end work, as well as database and deployment strategies. Here's what went into building it:

💻 Tech Stack & Features:
-> Backend: Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for creating a scalable, efficient server and database.
-> Frontend: EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates) for dynamic and seamless content rendering.
-> Authentication: Sign-up and login functionality built with Passport.js for secure user authentication.
-> Responsive Design: A fully responsive website design for smooth user experience on any device.

🔑 Main Features:
-> Categorized Listings: Users can browse listings by category—homes, farms, caves, islands, etc.
-> CRUD Capabilities: Users can create, update, and delete their listings.
-> Review Functionality: Reviews can be added to listings after login and also users can create and delete their reviews.
-> Profile Management: Users can view host details and create or update their own profiles.

☁ Deployment Details:
-> Image Storage: Used Cloudinary to store and manage images efficiently.
-> Database: MongoDB Atlas for reliable, cloud->based database storage.
-> Hosting: Render for deploying and hosting the front end.

Building and deploying this project taught me a lot about integrating different technologies and ensuring smooth connections between the frontend, backend, and database.
